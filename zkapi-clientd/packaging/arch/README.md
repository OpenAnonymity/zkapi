# Arch Linux / AUR

This directory is ready to copy to an AUR repository for `zkapi-clientd-bin`.
It installs the checksum-pinned `0.1.6` release for x86_64 or aarch64, the native
wallet companion and proving assets, and a systemd user service. Publication to
the AUR is a separate maintainer step.

To build and install this checkout on Arch Linux as a regular user:

```sh
cd zkapi-clientd/packaging/arch
makepkg -si
zkapi-clientd config
systemctl --user enable --now zkapi-clientd.service
```

Configure the wallet before starting its service. The service runs as your
user, uses the same default profile as the CLI, and keeps newly created files
private with `UMask=0077`. It does not perform interactive setup or funding.
Never run another client against the same wallet while the service is active.

```sh
systemctl --user status zkapi-clientd.service
journalctl --user -u zkapi-clientd.service
systemctl --user stop zkapi-clientd.service
```

To keep it running after logout, optionally enable lingering for your user:

```sh
loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
```

For a separate existing profile, use `systemctl --user edit zkapi-clientd` and
set an absolute directory before starting the service:

```ini
[Service]
Environment=ZKAPI_CLIENTD_CONFIG_DIR=/absolute/path/to/private-profile
```

The concrete `PKGBUILD` and `.SRCINFO` are generated from the `.in` templates
and the pinned release checksums. From the repository root, refresh both with:

```sh
python3 zkapi-clientd/scripts/sync-packages.py 0.1.6
```

## Docker validation

To use Docker on an explicitly selected SSH host from your local checkout, run this from the
repository root:

```sh
python3 zkapi-clientd/scripts/test-platforms-ssh.py user@docker-host.example --platform arch
```

On a Linux Docker host, run:

```sh
./zkapi-clientd/packaging/arch/test-docker.sh
# Optionally reuse already downloaded release archives:
./zkapi-clientd/packaging/arch/test-docker.sh /path/to/release-archives
```

The runner builds the package as a regular user, installs it with `pacman`,
checks both binaries and every proof asset, and exercises the installed service
with a real systemd user manager. It checks enable/start/stop and the expected
configuration guidance for a fresh profile, without creating a wallet. It uses
a disposable privileged Arch container to run systemd and removes that
container afterward. Only this package directory and optional release cache
are mounted, both read-only. Set `ARCH_IMAGE` to select another Arch image.

The startup check covers an unconfigured installation. Serving funded inference
requires the user's configured wallet; this test neither funds a wallet nor
submits live transactions.
