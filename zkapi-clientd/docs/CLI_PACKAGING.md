# Installation, updates and development

## One-command installation

Install or update the `0.1.6` prerelease:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/ethereum/zkapi/releases/download/clientd-v0.1.6/install.sh | bash
```

Then configure and serve:

```sh
zkapi-clientd config
zkapi-clientd serve
```

The command downloads a prebuilt native bundle and checks its SHA-256 before
activation. No compiler, Git or Python is needed. It assumes the installation's
`bin` directory is already on PATH. The default prefix is `~/.local`; use
`--prefix` for another writable absolute prefix. Configuration is separate from
installation unless `--setup` is supplied. A new profile defaults to Ethereum
Mainnet and direct HTTPS; `config --network sepolia` explicitly selects test ETH.

For updates, stop `serve`, rerun the same install command, then restart `serve`.
The previous bundle is retained, and configuration, signing keys and recovery
state remain in their private directory. The installer does not start services,
modify shell startup files or terminate running processes.

This exact-tag command works for prereleases. GitHub's repository-wide
`latest/download` URL excludes prereleases and may select unrelated operator
releases, so it is not used. The generated installer is pinned to its release.

Runtime requirements: macOS 13+ or Linux with glibc 2.39+, on amd64 or arm64;
Bash, curl, tar and SHA-256 tooling (`sha256sum` or `shasum`). Linux also needs
OpenSSL 3, libgcc and CA certificates.

## Platform packages and background services

Each client release includes generated platform package metadata pinned to its
native bundles. Each bundle contains the client, wallet companion, and
deployment-pinned proof assets, with SHA-256 checks for every supported archive.
The checked-in package pins are promoted after publication verifies all artifacts.

| Platform | Package | Background service |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nix / NixOS | [Flake and modules](../packaging/nix/README.md) | NixOS or Home Manager systemd user service |
| Arch Linux / AUR | [PKGBUILD and .SRCINFO](../packaging/arch/README.md) | `systemctl --user enable --now zkapi-clientd` |
| Homebrew | [Formula and tap setup](../packaging/homebrew/README.md) | `brew services start zkapi-clientd` |

Run `zkapi-clientd config` as the user who will run the service before starting
it. For Nix, follow the module's explicit configuration-directory instructions.
Services run `zkapi-clientd serve`, keep wallet state outside the package, and
can be stopped with the corresponding service manager. Stop a foreground daemon
before starting its service so they do not compete for the same wallet or port.
Package installation does not fund or initialize a wallet. An unconfigured
service either remains stopped (Nix modules) or exits with configuration guidance.

The AUR handoff and Homebrew formula are ready to copy into their respective
package repositories; adding them here does not publish an AUR entry or a public
Homebrew tap. The Nix flake can be used directly from this checkout.

## Wallet storage and updates

`--config-dir` or `ZKAPI_CLIENTD_CONFIG_DIR` explicitly selects the wallet's
private directory. Use the same directory when updating the client or resuming
configuration so signing keys, notes, signed transactions and recovery journals
remain together. The client uses the directory in place without copying,
deleting or re-keying wallet state.

Stop the running daemon before updating or changing configuration, and never
run two clients against one wallet. Malformed profiles, orphaned recovery files
and unsupported profiles require explicit attention; the client never silently
converts them. Preserve recovery data when resolving configuration errors.

## Native bundle

The managed layout is:

```text
PREFIX/bin/zkapi-clientd -> PREFIX/lib/zkapi-clientd/current/bin/zkapi-clientd
PREFIX/bin/zkapi-walletd -> PREFIX/lib/zkapi-clientd/current/bin/zkapi-walletd
PREFIX/lib/zkapi-clientd/current -> releases/RELEASE_DIRECTORY
PREFIX/lib/zkapi-clientd/releases/RELEASE_DIRECTORY/
  bin/zkapi-clientd
  bin/zkapi-walletd
  share/zkapi-clientd/proof-setup/
  share/zkapi-clientd/build-info.json
  share/zkapi-clientd/third-party/
```

The default prefix is `~/.local`. Keep the two binaries and `share` directory
together. The installer checks both binaries and switches `current` atomically;
previous bundles remain available. It does not terminate a running daemon.
The helper is private implementation machinery; use the frontend's `config`
and `serve` commands.

## Maintainer builds and releases

Source builds are optional developer tooling; the end-user command above uses
prebuilt binaries. For local development, `./scripts/install-source.sh` builds
and installs this checkout. It requires Git, Go 1.25+, Rust 1.93+, Python 3,
C/C++ tools, CMake, pkg-config and OpenSSL 3 development headers/libraries.
On macOS install Xcode command-line tools and the corresponding Homebrew tools.

```sh
./scripts/prepare-zkapi.sh /tmp/clientd-wallet-source
./scripts/build-native.sh 0.1.6 /tmp/clientd-artifacts /tmp/clientd-wallet-source
```

Run on the native target. Supported release targets are macOS 13+ and Linux
with glibc 2.39+, on amd64 or arm64. Linux runtime dependencies are OpenSSL 3,
libgcc and CA certificates. Local source builds use the host platform's ABI.

The client release namespace is `clientd-vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, separate from
operator/SDK releases. The client release workflow assembles checksum-pinned
installers and native archives, Homebrew/AUR/Nix metadata, and Linux packages,
then creates a draft release for publication. Homebrew taps and AUR packages
are not automatically published. Publish a client prerelease only after the
native, installer and package validation jobs succeed.

After publishing a release, add its tag and four native archive hashes to
`zkapi-clientd/packaging/releases/clientd-VERSION.json`, then refresh the
installable manifests from the templates and pinned hashes:

```sh
python3 zkapi-clientd/scripts/sync-packages.py 0.1.6
python3 zkapi-clientd/scripts/sync-packages.py 0.1.6 --check
```

Run these commands from the repository root. Update the version in the package
check workflow when promoting a new release. Release assembly independently
hashes the native archives; the checked-in Nix package never overrides the new
release's generated package.

`install.sh --version MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` selects a published native bundle from
`ethereum/zkapi`. Its release-generated form is pinned to its own version.
It supports install/update with the same prefix and optional `--setup`.
`--setup` runs configuration after activation; no configuration is performed
by default. Update the pinned README URL when publishing another client release.

The root Rust workspace uses a native-only operator layout.
The frontend prepares pinned companion commit
`20aa542ae98e767c0507133fd34b12a56f5ccd3d` with protocol commit
`8b2d4e3da921f956e1eb6b93afbf722a877c060c` in a separate build directory and applies
its reviewed bridge/transport patches. Source verification checks exact commits
and diffs. These patches must not be applied to the root workspace. Proving
assets remain deployment-pinned; never regenerate them for installation.

## Checks

```sh
go test -race ./...
go vet ./...
python3 scripts/test-install.py
python3 scripts/test-prepare-zkapi.py
python3 scripts/test-packages.py
```

The Go tests check deployment-manifest integrity, exact approved digest
matching, and persistence of wallet state. Fixture tests do not read an installed
profile or contact deployment endpoints.

The model-budget fixture is generated by executing the OA web client's real
pricing modules against synthetic public policy. When changing either client's
model policy, check it against a reviewed OA Chat checkout (no network or
wallet access):

```sh
node scripts/check-web-model-budgets.mjs /path/to/oa-chat
# After reviewing an intentional web policy change:
node scripts/check-web-model-budgets.mjs /path/to/oa-chat --write
```

The fixture stores the two source hashes and exercises live assignments,
unknown tiers, variants, fallback names and both reasoning settings. Go tests
compare the CLI's resulting helper allowance with those web-produced results.
Companion recovery tests use local mock servers and real signed wallet updates;
they never need production keys, funds or an installed wallet.

Native packaging and service-manager checks have extra platform dependencies;
see the client workflows. Fixture tests never need live funds.

Run all three platform checks in disposable Docker containers on an SSH host
(from the repository root):

```sh
python3 zkapi-clientd/scripts/test-platforms-ssh.py user@docker-host.example
```

Replace `user@docker-host.example` with your Docker host; the host argument is
required. The runner copies the source into a new remote temporary directory,
downloads the four pinned archives, verifies them against the checksum metadata, assembles
the current package definitions, and runs the Nix, Arch, and Linux Homebrew
checks. `--platform nix`, `--platform arch`, or `--platform homebrew` selects one.
Use `--artifacts /path/to/release` to reuse downloaded archives. Local logs are
written to `zkapi-clientd/build/platform-tests/`; `--logs` selects another directory.

The Docker host needs Python 3, curl, Bash, and permission to run Docker. Service
tests use disposable privileged containers with private cgroup namespaces so
systemd can run inside the container. They do not mount a host wallet or the
Docker socket. Each runner removes its own containers; the SSH runner removes
its temporary source and archives unless `--keep` is supplied.

These checks install real release binaries and test service configuration,
missing-profile behavior, and stopping. They do not configure or fund a wallet,
perform paid inference, or claim macOS `launchd` coverage. Homebrew's macOS
service checks remain part of the native release workflow.
